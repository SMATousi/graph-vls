## V-1: Jet Dataset & Graph Construction (FR-1) ✅ Complete 2026-07-20

**File:** `src/gvls/data/jets.py`. Tests: `tests/test_jets.py` (15 tests, all synthetic-jet unit tests — no network call in the suite itself, matching the existing precedent that `load_planetoid`/`load_tu_dataset` aren't exercised in `tests/` either; `load_qg_jets`'s actual `energyflow` download path was verified manually, see below).

| Check | Pass condition | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Dataset source confirmed | User has confirmed `energyflow.qg_jets` (or named an alternative) as the actual data source | ✅ User confirmed `energyflow.qg_jets` via `AskUserQuestion` (2026-07-20) |
| Jets load without error | A sample of jets returns valid `(x, edge_index, y)` triples | ✅ `load_qg_jets(num_jets=2000)` against real cached data: loads in ~1.3s (single 100k-jet `QG_jets.npz` file, already covers any subset up to 100k without further downloads), particle counts range 9–105, `x`/`edge_index`/`y` all well-formed |
| k-NN graph correctness | No self-loops, symmetric, edge count ≤ `k_graph` per node | Adjusted: union-symmetrized (not mutual-intersection) k-NN, the same tradeoff Phase 1 made for the latent-graph learner (`specs/phase1/plan.md`) to avoid emptying/disconnecting small graphs — this means per-node degree can slightly *exceed* `k_graph_cap` (a popular neighbor gets picked by more nodes than its own quota) rather than being strictly capped. No self-loops and full symmetry verified directly; degree bounded (tested ≤ `4×k_graph_cap`, empirically far tighter) rather than hard-capped at `k_graph_cap`. Periodic φ handled explicitly (`Δφ` wrapped to `[-π, π]`) and verified with a boundary-crossing test case. |
| Feature shape | `x.shape == (N, F)` with `F` matching Design Decision 6 | `F = NUM_FEATURES = 18`: `log(pT), y, φ` (3) + one-hot(pdgid) over 14 observed species + 1 "unknown" bucket (15) — higher than the plan's rough estimate of `F ≈ 15` because the dataset actually contains 14 distinct species (charge-separated), not ~11, plus the added unknown-species bucket for robustness at this system boundary |
| Split determinism | Same seed → identical train/val/test split | ✅ `split_jets` uses a seeded `torch.Generator`, mirroring `split_edges`'s convention; verified identical output across two calls with the same seed, different output across different seeds |
| Label balance | Quark/gluon ratio within tolerance on the subset | ✅ Exact 50/50 by construction — `load_qg_jets` samples `num_jets/2` from each label's pool rather than approximating a tolerance band (raw dataset is already ~49.9/50.1 so this required no aggressive oversampling; `raw_multiplier=1.3` cushion is ample) |

## V-2: Fixed-`M` Pooling for Jets (FR-2) ✅ Complete 2026-07-20

**File:** `src/gvls/compression/jet_sweep.py` (`train_pooled_gvls_on_jets`, `jet_loss`, `build_pooled_gvls`, `jet_adjacency`, `jet_pos_weight`). Tests: `tests/test_jet_sweep.py` (7 tests).

| Check | Pass condition | Result |
|---|---|---|
| `PooledGVLS` reused unmodified | No changes needed to `src/gvls/models/pooling.py` to support fixed absolute `M` per jet | ✅ Zero changes to `pooling.py` — `LatentGraphPooling(latent_dim, num_clusters=M)` already takes an absolute `M`, exactly as Design Decision 3 predicted |
| No cross-jet leakage | Per-jet assignment `S`/`A_z`/reconstruction independent of other jets in the same minibatch | ✅ Structurally guaranteed (each jet gets its own `model(x, edge_index)` call on its own dense tensors — no batched tensor ever spans two jets) and verified empirically: processing jet A, then a very-different-range jet B, then jet A again gives bit-identical output for jet A both times (`test_same_jet_gives_identical_output_regardless_of_other_jets_processed`, `test_disjoint_feature_ranges_do_not_mix`) |
| Gradient flow | Gradients reach encoder, pooling, and latent-graph-learner parameters after a minibatch of jets | ✅ Verified directly (`test_gradient_flows_to_all_submodules_from_one_jet`) — note the default `graph_method="attention"` latent-graph-learner has *zero* learnable parameters of its own (confirmed against `fgp`'s `log_tau` and `nri`'s MLP), so that check uses `fgp` instead; encoder/pooling gradient checks use the default config. Also verified the accumulation itself is numerically exact: summing `(loss/B).backward()` per jet across a 3-jet batch produces gradients identical to one `.backward()` on the batched mean loss (`test_gradient_accumulation_matches_batched_mean`) |
